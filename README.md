# Directory Tools
Tools comparing directories. This mainly was built to solve issues with keeping manual back-ups. Files will sometimes drift (renamed, missing, etc), and back-ups are sometimes really difficult to go through, especially with larger drives. The ultimate goal of this project is to make a client/server that will continuously check on changes made to backups, and to sync missing files.

# setup
General install includes:
1. Download python 3.10+
2. Add scripts folder in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python` to the environment variables for pip access

# searchDir
Basic tool that takes a folder parameter, and splits it into json objects. Example of usage:

    py .\searchDir.py -p ..\test_dir\a1\

File and Folder output will contain show file/folder structure.

# compareDir
Compares the output generated by searchDir. Example of usage:

    py .\searchDir.py -p ..\test_dir\a1\ -o output1.json
    py .\searchDir.py -p ..\test_dir\a2\ -o output2.json
    py .\compareDir.py -i .\output1.json .\output2.json

# analyzeDir
Still in Progress - will eventually be the main driver of the program that utilizes a configuration that executes tools.
